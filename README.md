A [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) package for remote multithreaded and GPU emulation of quantum computers, using [QuEST](https://quest.qtechtheory.org/).

> QuESTlink is currently considered as an early-release, and is under active development. 
> The offered API may contain bugs and is liable to change.

QuESTlink can be immediately deployed in Mathematica without installation. Simply run
```Mathematica
Import["https://qtechtheory.org/questlink.m"]

CreateDownloadedQuESTEnv[]
```

> Read the [Doc](Doc/README.md) to compile QuESTlink from source, to enable multithreading and GPU-acceleration, and set up a remote server.

To learn how to use QuESTlink, see our [whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07904), 
or some demos at [questlink.qtechtheory.org](https://questlink.qtechtheory.org).
